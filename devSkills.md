## Debugging

### Terminology

#### Breakpoint
A developer can add a breakpoint to the program to denote a stopping place in its execution. The program then will display the value of variables at that point only.

#### Stepping Through
In a suspended program, a developer has control of the program execution. To step through the code is to advance the execution point to the interesting section of code and examine the program state there.
